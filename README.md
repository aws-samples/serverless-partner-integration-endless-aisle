# serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle

This CDK constructs provides sample serverless solution for multiple partner integration. 

This AWS CDK application that provides a sample to create `Endless Aisle` solution for a retail organization. 
In today’s global world, many retailers do not have a business model to carry additional inventory, and own or lease warehouses. They do not want to worry about storing products. For a lean retailer, who carries enough inventory at the store, but does not want to lose any revenue because of shortage of inventory, Endless Aisle is an alternative solution to meet customer’s demand. This business model is known as drop-shipping, which means fulfilling the order through automated integration with the product partners.

Such automation would result in a customer’s ability to place an order on a tablet or kiosk when they do not find a specific product of their choice on shelves. Now, business no longer needs to stock products more than shelf deep. The end customer can easily place an order at the store for the product of their choice, and get it shipped to their home.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Build

To install and build the latest code in `serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/infrastructure` , `serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/infrastructure/lib/lambda` and `serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/website` folders:

1. First we wil install aws-cdk library locally.
```bash

npm install -g aws-cdk
```

2. Use build.sh file to install node packages, transpile typescript code, and create deployable files.
  
```bash

cd serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle && sh build.sh
```

Alternatively, you can perform the same steps one by as by as provided in subsquent section.

1. We will build website package to generate deployable website static content.

```bash

cd serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/website
npm install
```
2. Here we will install required packages, build infrastructure code, and Lambda code.

```bash
cd ../infrastructure
npm run package


## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth` in the project folder, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.

- Optional : 
    - If store wants to get updates about customer orders, they can set SENDER_EMAIL value with store email. You will receive verification email in this account, after which SES can send you order updates.
```bash

  export STORE_EMAIL="dummytest@someemail.com"
```


```bash

cd serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/infrastructure

cdk synth
cdk bootstrap
```

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

```bash

cdk deploy 
```

## Testing

### Create cognito user
Use following command to create a sample user, that you can use to generate Auth Token.

```bash
aws cognito-idp admin-create-user --user-pool-id <REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID> --username <UserName> --user-attributes Name="email",Value="<USER_EMAIL>" Name="email_verified",Value=true
```
- User will receive password in their email.
- Open CloudFront URL in a web browser. Login to the website with username and password. 
- Use features like Partner Lookup, Product search, Placing and order, and Order Lookup etc.
- If you have set up email correctly while setting the infrastructure, you will receive and email in the given email address for every order.
- Please approve email link received in email address.
- You can also use postman to generate ID_Token and call following API with token, or login into AWS account and test APIs using API GAteway's inbuilt testing page to see results.

## Clean up

Run `cdk destroy`. This will delete the Infrastructure and Website stack created in your AWS Account.

```bash
cdk destroy
```
