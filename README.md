# serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle

This CDK constructs provides sample serverless solution for multiple partner integration. 

This AWS CDK application that provides a sample to create `Endless Aisle` solution for an e-commerce company. `Endless Aisle` is an alternative solution to meet customer’s demand. It models as drop-shipping i.e. fulfilling the order through automated integration with the product or reseller partners. Such automation would result in customer’s ability to place the order on a tablet or kiosk when they do not find a specific product of their choice. It allows businesses to no longer keep stock products more than the shelf inventory and still the end customer can place an order and get it shipped at their home.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Build
To install and build the latest code in `serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/infrastructure` , `serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/infrastructure/lib/lambda` and `serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/website` folders:

1. First we wil install aws-cdk library locally.
```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

2. We will build website package to generate deployable website static content.

```bash
cd serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/website
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Here we will install required packages for our Lambda code.

```bash
cd ../infrastructure/lib/lambda
npm install
```

4. We will build Infrastructure package to create deployable assets which will be used in cloudfromation template. 

```bash

cd serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/infrastructure
npm install
npm run build
```

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth` in the project folder, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.

- Optional : 
    - If store wants to get updates about customer orders, they can set SENDER_EMAIL value with store email. You will receive verification email in this account, after which SES can send you order updates.
```bash
  export SENDER_EMAIL= dummytest@someemail.com
```


```bash

cd serveless-partner-integration-endless-aisle/infrastructure

cdk synth
```

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

1. Infrastruct
```bash
cdk deploy InfrastructureStack
```

2. Gather APIEndpoint, Cognito USER_POOL_ID, Cognito userpool USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID, AWS_REGION and update it in `.env` file.

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID=
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=
REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=
```

3. Infrastruct
```bash
cdk deploy WebsiteStack
```

## Testing

After the deployment CDK will output the API Gateway URL endpoint to be used for testing.

- Launch URL 


## Clean up

Run `cdk destroy --all`. This will delete the Infrastructure and Website stack created in your AWS Account.

```bash
cdk destroy --all
```

```bash  
    AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet
    AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet
    AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet
    AWSManagedRulesAnonymousIpList
    AWSManagedRulesAmazonIpReputationList
    AWSManagedRulesAdminProtectionRuleSet
